# R-Studio-Data-mining
• The dataset contains details of protein localisation sites for yeast. There are ten columns of different localisation sites which their values.
• Data mining, Visualisation and Data analysis has been carried out using the R language.
• For data mining seed of 1234 is used and 70-30 split has been used to create training and test data. After creating train and test data, the confusion matrix is produced to define the accuracy of the model.
• In visualisation, the heat map is generated from the confusion matrix. The predictions were normalised between 0 and 1. The ggplot packages are used to produce heatmap.
• Final in data analysis, the task performed has been reported and results are discussed with their parameters.
